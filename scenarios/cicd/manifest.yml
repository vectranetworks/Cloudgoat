        FooCorp is a company exposing a public-facing API. 
        Customers of FooCorp submit sensitive data to the API every minute.
        The API is implemented as a Lambda function, exposed through an API Gateway. 
        Because FooCorp implements DevOps, it has a continuous deployment pipeline 
        automatically deploying new versions of their Lambda function from source 
        code to production in under a few minutes.

        Your goal: steal the sensitive data submitted by FooCorp customers!
